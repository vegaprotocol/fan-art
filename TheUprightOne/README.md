Hi. Here is a peek into my little head. I had been following Vega since about February, when the market was at an all time high. I followed one of the initial seed investors, and they had just announced that they were part of a funding round for Vega. When I clicked through I was in awe at the simplicity and originality of the branding. I struggled to get it off my mind and in fact, started to design my much awaited portfolio site based on the pixel-sans serif typeface mix VEGA use.

The more I learned and interacted the more I got involved. Then I found Discord and a call for memes, graphics etc. From then on, I created a few 'Vegasapes' every other week, inspired by a blog, current theme or detail announced by Vega.

If you wish to build on these flat JPEGs, or wish to know anything about any of the elements, please reach out.
